# Mobile Applications

⚠️ **This folder is currently empty - reserved for future mobile apps.**

## Purpose

This will contain native mobile applications:
- `ios/` - iOS app (Swift/SwiftUI or React Native)
- `android/` - Android app (Kotlin or React Native)
- `shared/` - Shared mobile code (if using React Native)

## Technology Options

### Option 1: React Native
- ✅ Code sharing between iOS/Android
- ✅ Faster development
- ✅ Web developer friendly

### Option 2: Native (Swift + Kotlin)
- ✅ Best performance
- ✅ Full platform capabilities
- ✅ Native UI/UX

## When to Start

Start mobile development when:
1. Web app is feature-complete
2. User demand for mobile apps exists
3. Mobile-specific features are needed (widgets, shortcuts)

## Integration with Existing Code

Mobile apps will:
1. Reuse business logic from `shared/`
2. Use web API patterns as reference
3. Add mobile-specific features (widgets, watch app, etc.)
