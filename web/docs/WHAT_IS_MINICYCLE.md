# What is miniCycle?

**A Complete Guide to Understanding the Task Cycling Concept**

---

## 🎯 **The Core Concept: Task Cycling vs Traditional To-Do Lists**

### **Traditional To-Do Lists**
```
[ ] Buy groceries
[ ] Call mom  
[ ] Pay bills
[ ] Clean house

Complete task → Task disappears forever
```

### **miniCycle's Task Cycling**
```
Morning Routine:
[ ] Make coffee
[ ] Check emails
[ ] Exercise  
[ ] Plan day

Complete all tasks → All checkmarks removed → Same tasks ready again
```

**The Key Difference**: In miniCycle, **the tasks persist, only the completion status cycles**.

## 🔄 **What is a "Cycle"?**

A **cycle** is a **persistent list of tasks** that represents a routine, procedure, or workflow that you repeat.

### **Examples of Cycles**
- **Morning Routine**: Same tasks every day
- **Work Safety Checklist**: Same checks for every part/procedure  
- **Weekly Planning**: Same planning steps each week
- **Gym Workout**: Same exercises each session
- **Closing Procedures**: Same steps to close shop each night

### **What Happens When You "Complete a Cycle"**
1. ✅ All tasks show as completed
2. 🔄 All checkmarks get removed  
3. 📋 **Same tasks remain** - ready to do again
4. 📊 Cycle counter increases

**The routine structure stays intact, only the completion state resets.**

## 🎛️ **The Three Modes Explained**

miniCycle offers three different cycling behaviors to match different use cases:

### **🔄 Auto Cycle Mode**
**Behavior**: Tasks automatically reset when the last task is completed
**Use Cases**: 
- Daily routines that should start fresh each day
- Work procedures that immediately repeat
- Any workflow where completion = ready to start again

**Example**: Quality control checklist that runs continuously throughout the day

### **✋ Manual Cycle Mode** 
**Behavior**: You decide when to reset by pressing "Complete Cycle"
**Use Cases**:
- Weekly/monthly routines
- Project phases 
- Workflows where you control the timing
- Tasks with due dates spread across time

**Example**: Weekly planning checklist that you complete over several days

### **✅ To-Do Mode**
**Behavior**: Traditional to-do list - completed tasks get deleted
**Use Cases**:
- One-off tasks
- Shopping lists
- Project deliverables
- Anything you don't want to repeat

**Example**: Moving checklist, vacation planning, one-time projects

## 🏭 **Real-World Example: Manufacturing Job**

Let's look at how someone might use miniCycle in a manufacturing environment:

### **Cycle 1: "Part Inspection" (Auto Cycle Mode)**
```
[ ] Check part number     (High Priority)
[ ] Check job number      (High Priority)  
[ ] Check serial number
[ ] Verify specifications
[ ] Log in system
```
- **Repeats continuously** throughout the day
- **Auto-resets** when last item is checked
- **High priority** ensures critical steps aren't missed

### **Cycle 2: "Daily Maintenance" (Recurring Tasks)**
```  
[ ] Clean surface plate   (Recurs daily at 2:00 PM)
[ ] Calibrate tools       (Recurs weekly)
[ ] Safety inspection     (Recurs monthly)
```
- **Appears automatically** based on schedule
- **Completes for the period** when done
- **Returns next scheduled time**

### **Cycle 3: "Weekly Reports" (Manual Cycle Mode)**
```
[ ] Compile production data    (Due Monday)
[ ] Submit timesheet          (Due Wednesday)  
[ ] Update project status     (Due Friday)
[ ] Plan next week           (Due Friday)
```
- **Due dates spread across week**
- **Manual completion** when all weekly tasks done
- **Resets for next week** when you choose

### **Cycle 4: "Project Tasks" (To-Do Mode)**
```
[ ] Order new equipment
[ ] Train new employee
[ ] Install software update
```
- **One-time tasks** that get deleted when complete
- **No repetition** needed

## 🧠 **Why Task Cycling Works**

### **🔄 Routine Consistency**
- **Same task list** = consistent procedures
- **No rebuilding** routines from scratch
- **Muscle memory** develops faster

### **🎯 Mental Load Reduction**  
- **Familiar structure** reduces decision fatigue
- **Predictable workflow** increases efficiency
- **Nothing forgotten** because tasks persist

### **📊 Progress Tracking**
- **Cycle counts** show routine adherence  
- **Completion rates** reveal workflow efficiency
- **Streak tracking** motivates consistency

### **🔧 Flexibility**
- **Three modes** for different workflow types
- **Recurring tasks** for time-based activities
- **Due dates** for deadline management
- **Notifications** for time-sensitive reminders

## 🆚 **miniCycle vs Other Apps**

### **Traditional Task Managers (Todoist, Any.do, etc.)**
- ❌ Tasks disappear when completed
- ❌ Must rebuild routines constantly  
- ❌ No cycling concept
- ✅ Good for one-off projects

### **Habit Trackers (Habitica, Streaks, etc.)**
- ❌ Only track completion, don't manage tasks
- ❌ No complex workflows
- ❌ Limited task details
- ✅ Good for simple habit building

### **miniCycle**
- ✅ **Persistent routines** that don't disappear
- ✅ **Complex workflows** with multiple tasks
- ✅ **Flexible cycling** modes for different needs
- ✅ **Full task management** within routine structure
- ✅ **Time-based features** (recurring, due dates, notifications)

## 🎯 **Who Should Use miniCycle?**

### **Perfect For People Who:**
- **Repeat the same procedures** regularly (work, routines, workflows)
- **Need routine consistency** but struggle with traditional apps
- **Want privacy** (no accounts, local storage only)
- **Have complex scheduling** (daily + weekly + recurring tasks)
- **Work in process-driven environments** (manufacturing, healthcare, service)

### **Not Ideal For People Who:**
- **Only have one-off tasks** (traditional to-do apps better)
- **Don't repeat workflows** (no benefit from cycling)
- **Want cloud sync** (miniCycle is local-only for privacy)

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Step 1: Identify Your Routines**
Think about tasks you do repeatedly:
- Daily morning/evening routines
- Work procedures  
- Weekly planning sessions
- Monthly reviews

### **Step 2: Choose the Right Mode**
- **Auto Cycle**: For routines that immediately repeat
- **Manual Cycle**: For routines you control timing
- **To-Do**: For one-off tasks mixed in

### **Step 3: Set Up Your First Cycle**
- Add your routine tasks
- Set priorities for critical items
- Add due dates if needed
- Configure recurring tasks

### **Step 4: Start Cycling**
- Complete tasks as normal
- Watch the cycle reset and start fresh
- Track your progress over time

## 💡 **Key Insights**

### **🔄 The Cycle is the Product**
- You're not just managing tasks
- You're building and refining repeatable routines
- Each cycle improves your process

### **🎯 Completion ≠ Deletion**  
- Completing tasks shows progress
- Resetting maintains routine structure
- Both actions are valuable and separate

### **🛠️ Flexibility is Power**
- Different modes for different needs
- Mix cycling with traditional tasks
- Adapt to your actual workflow

## 🏆 **The miniCycle Advantage**

**miniCycle turns task management into routine management.**

Instead of constantly rebuilding task lists, you build **persistent workflows** that get better over time. You maintain **process consistency** while tracking **completion progress**.

**Result**: More efficient routines, less mental overhead, better habit formation.
