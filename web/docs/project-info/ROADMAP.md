### Three-Tier Ecosystem

miniCycle is **Tier 1** of SparkinCreations' product ecosystem:

1. **miniCycle** (Free) - Personal habit building & cycling introduction
2. **Task Cycle** ($25 one-time) - Professional workflows & advanced features
3. **Task Cycle Pro** ($10-15/month) - Team collaboration & cloud sync

**This roadmap covers miniCycle only.** Features like cloud sync, team collaboration, and advanced professional tools will be in Task Cycle/Pro.
