## What is miniCycle?

miniCycle is a **routine-building task manager** that helps you establish consistent habits and processes. Unlike traditional to-do apps that focus on one-time tasks, miniCycle is designed for **repeating routines** that cycle.

### Key Differences from To-Do Apps

| Traditional To-Do App | miniCycle |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Tasks deleted when done | Tasks reset and repeat |
| Focus on one-time actions | Focus on routines and habits |
| Linear progress | Cyclical progress |
| Task list empties | Task list persists |

### Who Should Use miniCycle?

- **Routine-oriented people** who repeat the same tasks regularly
- **Process followers** who have checklists or procedures
- **Habit builders** establishing new routines
- **Teams** with recurring workflows
- Anyone who finds themselves recreating the same to-do list over and over

---

## Getting Started

## Basic Concepts

### What is a Cycle?

A **cycle** is a named collection of tasks that represent a routine or process. Examples:
- "Morning Routine"
- "Weekly Cleaning"
- "Project Checklist"
- "Workout Plan"

### What Happens When You Complete a Cycle?

When all tasks in a cycle are checked off:
- ✅ **Cycle count increments** (tracks how many times you've completed it)
- 🔄 **Tasks reset to unchecked** (ready for next time)
- 📊 **Stats update** (completion rate, streaks)
- 🎉 **Celebration animation** (optional)

This is the core "cycling" concept that makes miniCycle unique!

## Understanding Modes

miniCycle has **three operational modes** to match different workflows. **Mode changes apply instantly without page reload (v1.372+)** - your tasks update in real-time!

### 1. Auto Cycle Mode (Default)

**How it works:**
- Complete all tasks → cycle **automatically resets**
- Best for: Daily routines, habits, recurring checklists

**Example:** Morning routine automatically resets every day when completed.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Hands-free operation
- ✅ Encourages consistency
- ✅ Great for habits

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Can't review completed state (resets immediately)

---

### 2. Manual Cycle Mode

**How it works:**
- Complete all tasks → **"Complete Cycle" button appears**
- You manually click button to reset
- Best for: Weekly reviews, project phases, intentional resets

**Example:** Weekly cleaning checklist that you review before resetting.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Control over when to reset
- ✅ Can review completed state
- ✅ Intentional completion

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires manual action

**How to enable:**
1. Menu → **Settings**
2. Find your cycle's settings
3. Toggle **"Manual Cycle Mode"**

---

### 3. To-Do Mode

**How it works:**
- Completed tasks are **deleted** (not reset)
- Best for: One-time tasks, traditional to-do lists

**Example:** Project tasks that won't repeat.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Familiar to-do list behavior
- ✅ List empties as you complete
- ✅ Good for one-time projects

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Tasks don't repeat (defeats cycling concept)

**How to enable:**
1. Menu → **Settings**
2. Find your cycle's settings
3. Toggle **"To-Do Mode"**

---

## Recurring Tasks

Recurring tasks **automatically recreate** themselves on a schedule.

### When to Use Recurring Tasks

- ✅ Tasks that repeat on a predictable schedule
- ✅ Time-sensitive reminders
- ✅ Maintenance tasks (daily, weekly, monthly)

**Examples:**
- "Take medication" (daily at 9 AM)
- "Water plants" (every 3 days)
- "Pay rent" (1st of every month)
- "Backup files" (every Sunday)

### Creating a Recurring Task

1. Add a task normally
2. Click **three dots (⋮)** → **"Make Recurring"**
3. Choose schedule:
   - **Hourly** (e.g., every 2 hours)
   - **Daily** (e.g., every day at 8 AM)
   - **Weekly** (e.g., every Monday and Friday)
   - **Monthly** (e.g., 15th of every month)
   - **Yearly** (e.g., January 1st)
4. Set duration (forever, X times, or until date)
5. Click **"Save"**

### Understanding Recurring Behavior

**Scenario 1: Task Not Yet Due**
- Recurring task **won't appear** in your list yet
- Appears automatically when scheduled time arrives

**Scenario 2: Task is Due**
- Task appears in your list
- Check it off when complete
- Task disappears until next scheduled time

**Scenario 3: Missed a Task**
- If you miss a scheduled occurrence, task **still appears**
- Only one instance appears (not multiple for missed times)
- Check it off whenever you get to it

**Scenario 4: During Cycle Reset**
- Recurring tasks are **removed** during cycle reset
- They'll reappear at next scheduled time

### Editing Recurring Tasks

1. Click **three dots (⋮)** → **"Edit Recurring"**
2. Modify schedule or duration
3. Click **"Save"**

Changes apply to **future occurrences** only.

### Stopping Recurring Tasks

1. Click **three dots (⋮)** → **"Stop Recurring"**
2. Task becomes a regular task
3. Won't recreate anymore

---

## Organizing Tasks

### Completed Tasks Dropdown (Optional)

Keep your active task list clean by separating completed tasks.

**How to enable:**

2. Toggle **"Show Completed Tasks in Dropdown"**

**Note:** When you complete a cycle, tasks return to the active list (reset).

---

### Task Priority

Mark important tasks with **high priority** flag:

1. Click **three dots (⋮)** → **"Set Priority"**
2. Task gets visual indicator (usually colored)
3. Focus on these first!

**Use cases:**
- Time-sensitive tasks
- Critical checklist items
- Tasks that block others

---

### Due Dates & Reminders

Add deadlines to tasks:

1. Click **three dots (⋮)** → **"Set Due Date"**

## Tips & Best Practices

### 🎯 For Daily Routines

1. **Order matters** - Put tasks in chronological order
2. **Start small** - Don't add too many tasks at first
3. **Be specific** - "Morning stretches (10 min)" better than "Exercise"
4. **Track time** - Add duration estimates to tasks
5. **Review weekly** - Adjust tasks that aren't working

---

### 🔄 For Recurring Workflows

1. **Use descriptive names** - "Weekly: Review analytics" better than "Check stats"
2. **Set reminders** - Don't rely on memory for scheduled tasks
3. **Batch similar tasks** - Group weekly tasks together
4. **Document steps** - Add sub-tasks for complex processes

---

### 📊 For Habit Building

1. **Start with one habit** - Don't overwhelm yourself
2. **Make it easy** - Lower the barrier (e.g., "Read 1 page")
3. **Track streaks** - Use stats panel to see progress
4. **Celebrate wins** - Review cycle count regularly
5. **Adjust as needed** - Habits take time to stick

---

### 🚀 Pro Tips

1. **Multiple cycles** - Create separate cycles for different contexts:
   - "Work Morning Routine"
   - "Evening Shutdown"
   - "Weekly Planning"

2. **Export backups** - Regularly export your cycles:
   - Menu → Settings → "Export Cycle"
   - Save `.mcyc` file to cloud storage

3. **Mobile & Desktop** - Use PWA on both:
   - Install on phone for on-the-go
   - Install on desktop for deep work

4. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Speed up task management:
   - See [Keyboard Shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts) below

5. **Undo/Redo** - Made a mistake?

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks not saving

**Problem:** Tasks disappear after refresh

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser settings - ensure cookies/localStorage enabled

3. Check if private/incognito mode (data doesn't persist)
4. Export cycle as backup before troubleshooting

---

### Recurring tasks not appearing

**Problem:** Scheduled recurring task doesn't show up

**Solutions:**
1. Check system time - ensure clock is correct
2. Wait 30 seconds - recurring system polls every 30s

4. Verify schedule in task settings (Edit Recurring)

---

### App not updating

4. Contact support if persists

---

### Mobile app not working offline

3. Check storage permissions
4. Reinstall PWA

---

### Lost data / Need to restore

**Problem:** Accidentally deleted cycle or tasks

**Solutions:**
1. **Undo button** - Click ↶ (up to 20 undos per cycle)
2. **Import backup** - If you exported a `.mcyc` file
3. **Browser history** - Some browsers cache localStorage
4. **Prevention:** Export cycles regularly as backups!
