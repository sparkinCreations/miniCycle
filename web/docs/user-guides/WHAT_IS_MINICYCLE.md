# ✨ What is miniCycle?

**Your Routine Manager That Resets Itself**

-----

## 🎯 The Simple Explanation

miniCycle is a routine manager.

You create **routines** made of tasks, complete them, and when all tasks are finished, miniCycle automatically resets the routine so it’s ready for next time.

It also tracks how many times you’ve completed each routine — these completions are your **cycles**.

Think of it like a checklist that never disappears and never needs rebuilding.

-----

## 🔁 How miniCycle Works (Super Simple)

### 1️⃣ You create a routine

Examples:

- Morning Routine
- Daily Inspection
- Cleaning Checklist
- Weekly Planning
- Gym Workout

### 2️⃣ You add tasks inside the routine

Examples:

- Make coffee
- Check email
- Stretch
- Review schedule

### 3️⃣ You complete all the tasks

When you check off the final task…

### 4️⃣ miniCycle resets the routine

All tasks become unchecked again — ready for next time.

(There’s a brief 1-2 second pause so you can see your completion!)

### 5️⃣ Your Cycle Count increases

Every completed routine adds **+1 cycle** to your progress.

## 🔄 Understanding “Routines” vs “Cycles”

### What’s a Routine?

A **routine** is the persistent checklist you create.

Examples:

- Your “Morning Routine” with 8 tasks
- Your “Quality Check” routine with 12 steps
- Your “Weekly Review” routine with 5 items

**The routine stays the same.** You create it once, and it never disappears.

### What’s a Cycle?

A **cycle** is one complete run-through of your routine.

Examples:

- Complete your Morning Routine → **1 cycle**
- Complete it again tomorrow → **2 cycles**
- Complete it 30 days in a row → **30 cycles**

**The cycle count tracks your consistency.** It shows how many times you’ve finished the entire routine.

### The Relationship

```
You CREATE routines
You COMPLETE cycles

Routine = The thing you build (permanent)
Cycle = Each time you finish it (tracked progress)
```

**In one sentence:**
“I created my Morning Routine, and I’ve completed 42 cycles of it this month.”

-----

## 🧠 The Core Idea

**Complete all tasks → tasks reset → cycle count goes up.**

That’s it. Simple. Predictable. Repeatable.

-----

## 📈 What Is a “Cycle”? (Deeper Dive)

A cycle is one full completion of your routine.

### Real-World Example:

**Morning Routine:**

```
[ ] Wake up at 6 AM
[ ] Drink water
[ ] Exercise 20 minutes
[ ] Shower
[ ] Make breakfast
[ ] Review today's goals
```

**First day:** Check all 6 tasks → **Cycle count: 1**  
**Second day:** Check all 6 tasks → **Cycle count: 2**  
**Third day:** Check all 6 tasks → **Cycle count: 3**

After a month: **Cycle count: 30** (if you completed it every day)

### Why Cycle Counts Matter

- **Track consistency** - See how often you actually complete routines
- **Build momentum** - Higher numbers = more motivation
- **Spot patterns** - Know which routines you’re maintaining vs. skipping
- **Unlock achievements** - Reach milestones (10 cycles, 50 cycles, 100 cycles!)

Every routine has its own cycle count.

## 🎛️ Three Modes for Different Needs

miniCycle offers three different ways routines can reset:

### 🔄 Auto Cycle Mode (Most Popular)

**How it works:**

- Check off the last task
- Wait 1-2 seconds (celebration moment!)
- Routine automatically resets
- Cycle count increases

**Perfect for:**

- Daily routines you do often
- Work checklists that repeat continuously
- Any routine where completion = ready to start again

**Example:** Quality inspection checklist that runs all day long

-----

### ✋ Manual Cycle Mode

**How it works:**

- Complete all tasks
- “Start New Cycle” button appears
- You click when ready to reset
- Tasks uncheck and cycle count increases

**Perfect for:**

- Weekly or monthly routines
- Routines with tasks spread over time
- When you want to review before resetting

**Example:** Weekly planning checklist you complete over several days

-----

### ✅ To-Do Mode

**How it works:**

- Complete a task → it gets deleted (not reset)
- “Delete Completed Tasks” button appears when all done
- Works like a traditional to-do list

**Perfect for:**

- One-time tasks
- Shopping lists
- Project deliverables
- Anything you don’t want to repeat

**Example:** Moving checklist or vacation planning

-----

## 🔥 Why miniCycle Helps You Stay Consistent

### ✔ You never rebuild your routines

Your routine stays exactly the same every time.

No more “What did I do yesterday?” or “What’s my morning routine again?”

### ✔ You always start fresh

After completion, everything resets to a clean slate.

No lingering completed tasks. No clutter. Just a fresh start.

### ✔ You track real progress

Cycle counts show consistency, not just good intentions.

42 cycles = you actually did the thing 42 times.

### ✔ You build momentum

Watching cycle counts increase feels good.

Each completion reinforces the routine.

### ✔ You maintain routine stability

Same steps every time = less chance of missing something important.

Especially valuable for work procedures or safety checklists.
