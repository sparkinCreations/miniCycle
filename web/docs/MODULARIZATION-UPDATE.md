## 🚀 Your Next Steps

### **This Week: Low-Risk Utilities**
1. **Task Utilities** (⚡ Static Utility)
   - Extract: `extractTaskDataFromDOM()`, `validateTaskData()`, `generateTaskId()`
   - Lines: ~300
   - Risk: Very Low
   - Template: Already in guide (line 1252)

2. **Date Utilities** (⚡ Static Utility)
   - Extract: `formatDate()`, `parseDate()`, `isOverdue()`
   - Lines: ~200
   - Risk: Very Low
   - Use same pattern as Task Utilities

### **Next Week: Theme Manager**
3. **Theme Manager** (🎯 Simple Instance)
   - Extract: `applyTheme()`, `updateThemeColor()`, `setupDarkModeToggle()`
   - Lines: ~800
   - Risk: Low
   - Template: Already in guide (line 1305)

## 🎓 Pattern Assignment Logic

The guide now clearly shows which pattern to use for each module:

- **Pure functions** (task utils, date utils) → ⚡ Static Utility
- **Self-contained UI** (theme manager, modal manager) → 🎯 Simple Instance
- **Complex UI with dependencies** (undo/redo) → 🛡️ Resilient Constructor
- **Critical business logic** (migration manager, task core) → 🔧 Strict Injection
