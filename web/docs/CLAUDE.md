# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Essential Commands

### Development Server
```bash
npm start                    # Starts Python HTTP server on port 8080
# Alternative: python3 -m http.server 8080
```

### Version Management
```bash
./update-version.sh          # Interactive version updater for app and service worker
                            # Updates all files with version references
                            # Creates automatic timestamped backups
                            # Validates changes after completion
```

### Blog System (Optional)
```bash
npm run blog:install        # Install blog dependencies
npm run blog:build          # Build static blog from markdown posts
```

### File Access
- **Main App**: http://localhost:8080/miniCycle.html (full version)
- **Lite Version**: http://localhost:8080/miniCycle-lite.html (ES5 compatible)

## Architecture Overview

### Core Philosophy
miniCycle implements **task cycling** - a methodology where task lists persist and only completion status resets, enabling routine building rather than traditional to-do management. This is fundamentally different from standard task apps.

### Dual Version System
- **miniCycle.html + miniCycle-scripts.js**: Full ES6+ version with all features
- **miniCycle-lite.html + miniCycle-lite-scripts.js**: ES5 compatible version for older browsers

### Modular ES6 Architecture
The main application (`miniCycle-scripts.js`) serves as an orchestrator that dynamically imports specialized modules:

```javascript
// CRITICAL: version.js provides single source of truth for APP_VERSION
// Loaded first in HTML before any scripts execute
// Available as window.APP_VERSION in browser, self.APP_VERSION in service worker

// Core module loading pattern with cache-busting
const withV = (path) => `${path}?v=${window.APP_VERSION}`;

// Exception: appInit must load WITHOUT version to maintain singleton
const { appInit } = await import('./utilities/appInitialization.js');

// All other modules use versioned imports for proper cache invalidation
const { MiniCycleNotifications } = await import(withV('./utilities/notifications.js'));
const { StatsPanelManager } = await import(withV('./utilities/statsPanel.js'));
const { MiniCycleState } = await import(withV('./utilities/state.js'));
```

### Key Architectural Components

#### State Management (`utilities/state.js`)
- Centralized state with undo/redo capabilities
- Event-driven architecture with `cycle:ready` events
- Automatic localStorage persistence with migration system
- Schema version 2.5 with backward compatibility

#### Module System (`utilities/`)
- **notifications.js**: Advanced notification system with drag support and educational tips
- **statsPanel.js**: Statistics panel with swipe navigation and achievement system
- **deviceDetection.js**: Platform-specific feature detection and optimization
- **themeManager.js**: Dynamic theming system with unlockable themes
- **cycle/cycleLoader.js**: Data loading, migration, and file import/export (.mcyc format)
- **cycle/cycleManager.js**: Cycle creation, onboarding, and management
- **cycle/cycleSwitcher.js**: Cycle switching with modal UI
- **cycle/modeManager.js**: Auto/Manual/Todo mode management

#### Global State Management
```javascript
window.AppGlobalState = {
  // Drag and touch interaction state
  draggedTask: null,
  isDragging: false,
  // Undo/redo system
  undoStack: [],
  redoStack: [],
  // UI state tracking
  advancedVisible: false,
  // Feature flags
  hasInteracted: false
};
```

### Data Schema (Version 2.5)
```javascript
{
  schemaVersion: 2.5,
  cycles: {
    [cycleId]: {
      name: string,
      tasks: Task[],
      cycleCount: number,
      autoReset: boolean,        // Auto Cycle Mode
      deleteCheckedTasks: boolean // To-Do Mode
    }
  },
  appState: {
    activeCycleId: string,
    currentMode: 'auto-cycle' | 'manual-cycle' | 'todo-mode'
  }
}
```

### PWA Implementation
- **service-worker.js**: Cache-first strategy with versioned updates
- **manifest.json / manifest-lite.json**: PWA configuration for both versions
- Offline functionality with background sync capabilities

## Critical Development Patterns

### Event-Driven Initialization
The app uses a sophisticated initialization system to ensure modules load after data is ready:

```javascript
// Wait for data before initializing UI components
document.addEventListener('cycle:ready', () => {
  // Safe to access cycle data and update UI
});
```

### Version Synchronization & Cache Busting
**CRITICAL:** All modules must use versioned imports to prevent cache issues.

**version.js** - Single Source of Truth:
```javascript
// Auto-generated by update-version.sh
self.APP_VERSION = '1.330';
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Without versioned imports, modules cache with different URLs causing duplicates
- Example: `notifications.js` (un-versioned) AND `notifications.js?v=1.330` (versioned)
- Service worker caches both, users stuck on old cached versions
- Incrementing version forces cache invalidation: `?v=1.330` → `?v=1.331`

**Critical Pattern:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Version helper for cache busting
const withV = (path) => `${path}?v=${window.APP_VERSION}`;
await import(withV('./utilities/module.js'));  // module.js?v=1.330

// ❌ WRONG - Un-versioned import creates cache duplicates
await import('./utilities/module.js');  // Will cache separately!

// ⚠️ EXCEPTION - appInit stays un-versioned (singleton requirement)
const { appInit } = await import('./utilities/appInitialization.js');
```

**Use `./update-version.sh`** to synchronize across all files:
- version.js (single source of truth)
- HTML meta tags and cache-busters
- Service worker CACHE_VERSION and APP_VERSION
- Manifest files
- Module @version JSDoc annotations

### Module Communication Pattern
Modules communicate through dependency injection rather than global state:

```javascript
const statsPanel = new StatsPanelManager({
  showNotification: notifications.show.bind(notifications),
  loadMiniCycleData: window.loadMiniCycleData
});
```

### Data Migration Strategy
Always preserve backward compatibility when modifying data schema:
- Increment schema version
- Add migration logic in `cycle/cycleLoader.js`
- Test with legacy data files
- Create backup before migration

## Task Cycling Core Concepts

### Three Operational Modes
1. **Auto Cycle Mode**: Tasks reset automatically when all completed
2. **Manual Cycle Mode**: User controls when to reset via "Complete Cycle"
3. **To-Do Mode**: Traditional behavior - completed tasks are deleted

### Persistent vs Disposable Tasks
- **Cycles**: Persistent task lists that reset completion status (routines, procedures)
- **To-Do**: Disposable tasks that get deleted when completed (one-time actions)

This distinction is fundamental to understanding miniCycle's value proposition and should be preserved in any modifications.

## File Structure Significance

### Backup System
- `backup/`: Automatic timestamped backups created by update-version.sh
- Each backup includes restore.sh script for easy rollback
- Maintains last 3 backups automatically

### Data Files
- `data/*.mcyc`: Sample cycle files demonstrating the .mcyc export format
- Used for testing import/export functionality

### Legacy Code
- `TTO/`: Contains older development artifacts and merge scripts
- Generally safe to ignore for current development

## PWA and Performance Considerations

### Service Worker Updates
When modifying core files, increment both app version and cache version to trigger proper PWA updates:
- Users receive update prompts automatically
- Cache invalidation prevents stale content
- Offline functionality remains intact

### Memory Management
- Large task lists (>100 tasks) may impact performance
- localStorage has browser-imposed limits
- Modular loading reduces initial bundle size

## Testing and Validation

### Built-in Testing Modal
Access via Settings → App Diagnostics & Testing:
- Health checks for data integrity
- Browser compatibility validation
- Debug information export

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. Test both full and lite versions
2. Verify PWA installation and offline functionality
3. Test data migration with legacy files
4. Validate undo/redo functionality
5. Check stats panel updates after data loading

## Important Notes for AI Assistants

### Conceptual Understanding
miniCycle is NOT a traditional task manager. It's a routine management system where:
- Tasks represent steps in repeatable procedures
- Completion status cycles, but task structure persists
- The goal is habit formation and process consistency

### Common Misconceptions to Avoid
- Don't treat cycles as disposable to-do lists
- Don't assume completed tasks should be deleted by default
- The cycling mechanism is the core value proposition, not an edge case

### When Making Changes
- Always test the stats panel data synchronization (known previous issue)
- Use the update-version.sh script for version changes
- Preserve the modular architecture and async loading patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing .mcyc files
