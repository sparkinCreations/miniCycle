# Recurring Settings Preservation - Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-10-07

## Problem
When users toggled recurring OFF and then back ON, their custom settings were lost and replaced with defaults.

## Solution
Modified `recurringCore.js` to preserve recurring settings when toggling OFF, and restore them when toggling back ON.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. `handleRecurringTaskActivation()` (line 510-519)
**Before:**
```javascript
task.recurringSettings = normalizeRecurringSettings(structuredClone(defaultSettings));
```

**After:**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Use existing settings if task was previously recurring, otherwise use defaults
if (!task.recurringSettings || Object.keys(task.recurringSettings).length === 0) {
    // First time setting to recurring - use defaults
    task.recurringSettings = normalizeRecurringSettings(structuredClone(defaultSettings));
    console.log('üìù First-time recurring activation - using default settings');
} else {
    // Task was previously recurring - preserve existing settings
    task.recurringSettings = normalizeRecurringSettings(structuredClone(task.recurringSettings));
    console.log('üìù Re-activating recurring - preserving previous settings:', task.recurringSettings);
}
```

### 2. `handleRecurringTaskDeactivation()` (line 647-650)
**Before:**
```javascript
if (targetTask) {
    targetTask.recurring = false;
    targetTask.recurringSettings = {}; // ‚ùå Settings lost!
    targetTask.schemaVersion = 2;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (targetTask) {
    targetTask.recurring = false;
    // ‚úÖ Keep recurringSettings so they can be restored if user toggles back on
    // Don't set to {} - preserve the settings!
    targetTask.schemaVersion = 2;
}
```

## User Flow Examples

### Scenario 1: First-time recurring activation
```
1. User creates task "Take medication"
2. User toggles recurring ON
   ‚Üí Settings: daily, indefinite (default)
3. ‚úÖ Correct: Uses default settings
```

### Scenario 2: Re-activation with preserved settings
```
1. User creates task "Take medication"
2. User toggles recurring ON
   ‚Üí Settings: daily, indefinite (default)
3. User customizes: "Daily at 9:00 AM"
   ‚Üí Settings: daily, 9:00 AM, indefinite
4. User toggles recurring OFF
   ‚Üí Settings preserved in task.recurringSettings
5. User toggles recurring ON again
   ‚Üí Settings: daily, 9:00 AM, indefinite ‚úÖ
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple toggle cycles
```
1. Task "Weekly meeting"
2. Set recurring: Weekly on Mon/Wed/Fri at 2:00 PM
3. Toggle OFF (settings preserved)
4. Toggle ON (settings restored: Weekly Mon/Wed/Fri at 2:00 PM) ‚úÖ
5. Change to: Weekly on Tue/Thu at 3:00 PM
6. Toggle OFF (new settings preserved)
7. Toggle ON (settings restored: Weekly Tue/Thu at 3:00 PM) ‚úÖ
```

## Technical Details

### Data Persistence
- **Task object:** `task.recurringSettings` preserved even when `task.recurring = false`
- **Recurring template:** Deleted from `cycle.recurringTemplates` when toggled OFF
- **Restoration:** Template recreated from preserved `task.recurringSettings` when toggled ON

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Empty settings object:** `Object.keys(task.recurringSettings).length === 0` ‚Üí Use defaults
2. **Undefined settings:** `!task.recurringSettings` ‚Üí Use defaults
3. **Valid settings:** Any populated object ‚Üí Preserve and restore
