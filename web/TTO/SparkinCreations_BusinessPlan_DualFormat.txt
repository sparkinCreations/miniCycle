Risk Scenarios & Responses
- Low miniCycle adoption → Talk to users, iterate quickly.

- Limited personal time → Keep products simple, iterate in steps.
- Competitors copy concept → Focus on execution and polish.

90-Day Action Plan
Month 1: Ship miniCycle
- Final testing, sparkinCreations.com live, launch to friends/family, feedback system.

Month 2: Gather Feedback

2. Talk to users constantly.
3. Focus on one thing at a time.
4. Quality over quantity.
5. Sustainable pace (marathon, not sprint).
6. Always solve real problems.
