    <h1>🔒 Privacy Policy for miniCycle</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 2, 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 2, 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Policy Version:</strong> 2.0</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
      <p>sparkinCreations is committed to transparency in its products. miniCycle is designed as a privacy-first application where you remain in full control of your data. All task information, cycles, reminders, and settings stay stored locally on your device.</p>
      <p><strong>The simple truth: We don't collect, store, or have access to your personal data.</strong> Period.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What miniCycle Does Not Collect</h2>
      <p>miniCycle does not collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>Account details or login credentials</li>
        <li>Task content or cycle data</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
        <li>Device information or IP addresses</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Advertising or profiling data</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
      <p><strong>All your data stays local.</strong> miniCycle stores the following information on your device using browser localStorage:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Task lists and completion history</li>
        <li>Cycle configurations and progress</li>
        <li>Recurring task templates</li>
        <li>Reminder settings</li>
        <li>Theme preferences and unlock progress</li>
        <li>App settings and customizations</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> This data remains on your specific device and browser. miniCycle cannot access this information remotely, and sparkinCreations has no visibility into your private task data. If you switch browsers or devices, your data will not transfer unless you manually export and import it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Optional Features</h2>
      <p>miniCycle may include optional features that allow you to share limited data if you choose. Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Submitting feedback or bug reports</strong> - May include your comments and optional contact information</li>
        <li><strong>Exporting task lists or cycles</strong> - You control where exported files are saved</li>
        <li><strong>Participating in beta features</strong> - Some new features may require limited data sharing to function</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Use of these features is always voluntary.</strong> miniCycle will never transmit data from your device unless you explicitly choose to activate one of these features. You will always be clearly informed before any data leaves your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Purpose of Optional Data</h2>
      <p>Any optional data you decide to share is used solely for its stated purpose:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improving the app based on your feedback</li>
        <li>Enabling features you've requested (like exports or sharing)</li>
        <li>Troubleshooting technical issues you've reported</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>We will never:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sell your data to third parties</li>
        <li>Use your data for advertising or profiling</li>
        <li>Share your data beyond its stated purpose</li>
        <li>Keep your data longer than necessary</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Security & Technical Safeguards</h2>
      <p>miniCycle is designed to keep your task data private and secure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No remote transmission</strong> - Your data never travels over the internet unless you use an optional export/sharing feature</li>
        <li><strong>No servers</strong> - We don't maintain servers that store your information</li>
        <li><strong>Input sanitization</strong> - Protection against malicious code injection</li>
        <li><strong>Browser security</strong> - Data stored in standard browser security contexts</li>
        <li><strong>Secure optional features</strong> - If you choose to use features that transmit data, that data is handled securely and only for its intended purpose</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Your Rights & Control</h2>
      <p>Since we don't collect your data, you maintain complete control:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Delete</strong> - Clear your data anytime through the app's "Factory Reset" option or by clearing browser data</li>
        <li><strong>Export</strong> - Download your data as .mcyc files whenever you want</li>
        <li><strong>Access</strong> - All your data is already accessible to you locally</li>
        <li><strong>Correct</strong> - Edit your tasks and settings directly in the app</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer</strong> - Export and import data to move between devices</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
      <p>This privacy policy complies with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> - European Union</li>
        <li><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong> - United States</li>
        <li><strong>Other applicable privacy laws</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since miniCycle doesn't collect personal data, most privacy regulations don't apply to our data practices. However, we've designed miniCycle to exceed privacy standards regardless.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>miniCycle does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The app operates independently in your browser.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>miniCycle does not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under 13. Since all data stays local on the device and we have no access to it, we cannot determine the age of our users. Parents and guardians should supervise children's use of any web application.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>If we need to update this privacy policy (for example, if we add optional cloud features), we will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Notify users prominently</strong> in the app with clear explanations</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain our privacy-first approach</strong> in any new features</li>
        <li><strong>Give users full control</strong> over any new data handling options</li>
        <li><strong>Update the "Last Updated" date</strong> at the top of this policy</li>
        <li><strong>Never make existing features less private</strong> without your explicit opt-in</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can always find the current version of this policy at <a href="https://minicycle.app/privacy">minicycle.app/privacy</a>.</p>
    </div>
