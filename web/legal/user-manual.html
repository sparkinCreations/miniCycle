        <h1>📖 Mini Cycle - User Manual</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>🚀 Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Mini Cycle! This user manual will guide you through the features and functionalities of the app.</p>
            <p>Mini Cycle is a new way of handling your repeatable tasks. 
                Most task managers treat each task as a one-off item and collect your personal data. 
                Mini Cycle is different - it's a privacy-focused workflow tool that organizes your tasks into manageable cycles.
                When you complete all your tasks, the cycle is completed and they automatically reset so you can tackle them again. 
                It's perfect for daily routines, weekly goals, and recurring habits.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Click the <strong>+ Add Task</strong> button to create your first task</li>
                <li>Check off tasks as you complete them</li>
                <li>When all tasks are completed, the cycle automatically resets (if Auto-Reset is enabled)</li>
