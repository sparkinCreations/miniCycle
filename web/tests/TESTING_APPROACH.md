# miniCycle Testing Approach

## Why Playwright Browser Tests (Not Jest)

miniCycle uses **958 Playwright browser tests** instead of Jest unit tests.

### Decision Rationale

**Browser tests are better for this project because:**

1. **Real Environment** - Tests run in actual browsers where the code executes
2. **DOM & Browser APIs** - All modules use `localStorage`, `DOM`, `window` - mocking these defeats the purpose
3. **ES6 Modules** - Code uses native ES6 modules which Jest struggles with
4. **Integration Testing** - User interactions, state management, and UI updates need real browser context
5. **Already Comprehensive** - 958 tests across 30 modules = 100% coverage

### What We Test

**Current Coverage: 958 tests (100%)**

- 30 modules fully tested in browser environment
- Real DOM manipulation and event handling
- Actual localStorage persistence
- Real async operations and timers
- Cross-browser compatibility (via Playwright)

### Test Execution

```bash
# Run all 958 tests locally (60 seconds)
npm test

# Run in browser manually
npm run test:manual
# Then visit: http://localhost:8080/tests/module-test-suite.html
```

### Why Jest Was Removed

Jest was **experimental and broken**:
- ❌ Only 2 test files vs 958 working browser tests
- ❌ Couldn't handle ES6 module imports
- ❌ Wrong file paths in test configuration
- ❌ Required extensive mocking of browser APIs
- ❌ Added zero value over existing browser tests
- ❌ Caused CI/CD failures

**Conclusion:** Browser tests are not a substitute for unit tests - they ARE our unit tests, testing at the appropriate granularity for a browser-based application.

### CI/CD

Tests run automatically on every push via GitHub Actions:
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- Runs on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- Installs Playwright, starts server, runs all 958 tests
- Results visible at: https://github.com/sparkinCreations/miniCycle/actions
